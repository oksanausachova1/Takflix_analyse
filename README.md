`Description`

We conducted a data analysis of the popular streaming platform Takflix. Our goal was to understand how users interact with the platform, identify loyal customers, calculate loyalty coefficients and gift coefficients. Additionally, we extracted the first three movies that customers watch for the first and second time in English.

`Objective`

Our main objective in this project was to thoroughly investigate the data from the Takflix platform and address the following questions:

``Data Validation``: We ensured that all necessary data was present and ready for further analysis.

`Identification of Loyal Customers`: We established criteria for identifying loyal users and successfully recognized them.

`Loyalty and Gift Coefficients`: We computed loyalty coefficients for users and gift coefficients for their activities on the platform.

`First Three Movies`: We extracted the first three movies that customers watch for the first and second time

Graphs of the loyalty coefficient and gifts are attached!
